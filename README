The goal here is to have a simple blog, just HTML+RSS, without having to write
it all by hand. The blogger writes a simple text file with one paragraph per
line, and it gets automatically converted into an HTML document. The text file
can also contain directives for generating certain elements (see
blog/example.txt).

If you want to use this setup to host your own blog then simply fork this repo
and delete the contents of the blog/ directory, then personalize the files in
blog.info/ to fit your blog. When you're ready to post, just run the ./build
script then commit and push your changes!

For the blog to be hosted on Github pages you'll need to set the title of the
repo to <your username>.github.io and then you will be able to find the blog at
<your username>.github.io/blog/

The RSS feed will get automatically updated by the blog's build script so you
shouldn't need to worry about it. But in the rare case where you want to
re-push the post to the feed (for example you've made a major edit and you
don't want it to go "under the radar" for your RSS users) then you should run
./bump ./blog/post.txt (where post.txt is the post you want to re-push to the
RSS feed) instead of running the build script. In the RSS reader this will
appear as if the post was duplicated.

To be clear, you don't need to use the bump script for your blog to have RSS
functionality, the build script will handle that for you automatically.
