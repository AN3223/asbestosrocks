A Straightforward Blogging Environment for Simple Text Oriented Sharing of
Random Opinions/Creativity/Knowledge/Stuff

The goal is to have a simple blog without having to write it all by hand. The
blogger writes a simple text file which gets converted to an HTML document. The
first line is the title, and every subsequent line is a paragraph. Some
directives are also available for images/links/indexes (see ./example).

If you want to use this setup to host your own blog then simply:

1) Fork this repo (for Github Pages repo name must be <username>.github.io)
2) Populate ./info/ with the following files:
	- ./info/info, shell script defining four variables:
		- DESCRIPTION
			- A description for your blog
		- TITLE
			- A title for your blog, used for RSS and blog/index.html
		- LINK
			- A link to your blog, used for RSS
		- AUTHOR (optional)
			- You
	- ./info/header (optional), html for the beginning of <body>
	- ./info/footer (optional), html for the end of <body>
	- ./info/css (optional), css to be embedded into <style>
3) Write posts in ./text/*
4) ./build
5) rm .gitignore
6) Share your posts by committing + pushing your changes

HTML posts will be in the blog/ directory, plaintext posts will be in phlog/

The RSS feed is automatically updated by ./build so you usually shouldn't worry
about it. But in the rare case you want to re-push the post to the feed (e.g.,
you've made a major correction and you don't want it to go unnoticed by your
RSS subscribers) then run ./bump ./blog/<post> (where <post> is the post to be
re-pushed to the RSS feed). In the RSS reader this will appear as if the post
was duplicated. This may be annoying for RSS subscribers, so use this
sparingly.
