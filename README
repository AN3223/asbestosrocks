The goal here is to have a simple blog, just HTML+RSS, without having to write
it all by hand. The blogger writes a simple text file with one paragraph per
line, which gets converted to an HTML document. The text file can also contain
directives for generating certain elements (see text/.example).

If you want to use this setup to host your own blog then simply:

1) Fork this repo (for Github Pages, repo name must be <username>.github.io)
2) rm -r ./text/* ./blog/*
3) Edit the files in ./blog.info/ to personalize your blog
4) Write posts in ./text/*
5) ./build
6) Share your posts by committing + pushing your changes

The posts will be in the blog/ directory, you may want to set this as the blog

The RSS feed is automatically updated by ./build so you usually shouldn't worry
about it. But in the rare case you want to re-push the post to the feed (e.g.,
you've made a major correction and you don't want it to go unnoticed by your
RSS subscribers) then run ./bump ./blog/<post> (where <post> is the post to be
re-pushed to the RSS feed). In the RSS reader this will appear as if the post
was duplicated. This may be annoying for RSS subscribers, so use this
sparingly.
